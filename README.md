# vortex_3d_spinoff
3D spinoff of a game made by a friend of mine; [Cloneos](https://github.com/cloneos).

This game is made in Unity and to play this version, download the latest release from here.

# How to play
Click on one of the 4 blocks, each selecting a different difficulty. Upon loading in, avoid the green circle with your cursor. You can push it back by pressing left mouse button. The green and red bar are health and laser power respectively. If you run out of health the game is over.
